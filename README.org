#+TITLE: Notes

This is just a sample project for seeing how Doxygen works.

* Steps

** Setup Doxygen configuration
#+begin_src shell
doxygen -g <config file (defaults to Doxyfile)
#+end_src

** Fine-tune Configuration

1. Set ~PROJECT_NAME~ to the project name.
2. Set ~INPUT~ to the subdirectories containing documented files.
   If left empty Doxygen will just scan the current directory; however, it's better to be explicit.
   If there is a directory containing dependencies, you may want to include that directory if it is documented.
   Even if the dependencies are not documented, Doxygen may be able to piece together object relationships to give you something to work with.
